# CV App

This app is my first react application. 

## About the app

This app will allow you to enter personal information, along with education and practical work experience. It will then be able to show you a preview of your finished CV.

## What I'm gaining experience with

### `React class components`

Making and using class components. This includes passing props to multiple components, setting and altering state, and nesting components.

### `More organized files`

Making multiple css files for each component(probably not practical in real world for such small files but good practice). This also includes trying to write clever code, like making reusable components.

### `Having a better git workflow`

Though this may still be rough, I'm trying to get more familiar with git commands and making smarter/better commits and pushes.

### `Creating a better README`

This one will be glaringly obvious (hopefully) looking at older project READMEs. I'm trying to create a better read me to show what the project is about and how its helping me improve my skillset
